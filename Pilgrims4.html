        <p>This is famous out of all the temples in Haridwar for being the abode
             of the Goddess, who is supposed to be an avatar of Goddess Shakti.
              According to legend, she was born out of the mind of Lord Shiva. 
              The term ‚ÄòMansa‚Äô is supposed to be in reference to the belief that 
              any devotee who prays to her with honest devotion and sincerity gets 
              their wish fulfilled.

        <p>It is the name of one of the ghats on the bank of the holy river Ganga, and that‚Äôs 
            why the temple to pray to her is located there. Out of all the Haridwar temples,
             the biggest attraction to devotees here is taking a dip or ‚Äòdupki‚Äô in the holy 
             river, which is said to wash off all sins of the devotee and thus give them a 
             second chance of achieving Moksha.
