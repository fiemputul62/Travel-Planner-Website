            and a Biosphere Reserve in 1989. Then declared as a National Park in 1990. Contiguous 
            with the Royal Manas National Park in Bhutan, the park is known for its rare and

            scenery and natural landscape which includes a range of forested hills, sedimentary grasslands, 
            and tropical evergreen forests. It was also named one of the World Heritage Sites in Danger but was 
            restored after extensive conservation efforts in 2011.
