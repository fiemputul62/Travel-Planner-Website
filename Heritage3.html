        <!--Humayun's Tomb -->
        <div id="humayun">
            <h2 id="hum"><u>Humayun's Tomb</u></h2>
            <p>This garden-tomb was chosen as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1993 for its
                 grandeur design and monumental scale that had no predecessor in the history 
                 of Islamic mausoleums. Another reason for selecting Humayun’s Tomb is that it 
                 is the first significant structure symbolizing the Mughal dynasty.The design of 
                 the tomb depicts charbagh (four quadrant gardens with four rivers, which is a 
                 representation of Quranic paradise) where the pools are joined by channels. 
                 The gigantic tomb rests on a tall and wide terraced platform and is surmounted 
                 by a marble-clad double dome. Overall, this “dormitory of the Mughals” as it is 
                 called, is a beautiful ensemble of red sandstone with black and white inlaid marble.

                <h2 id="qutub"><u>Qutub Minar and Its Monuments</u></h2>
                <p>The Qutub Minar is a monument straight from your upper primary history 
                    books and you might even have written boring essays on its history and 
                    importance. Yet, this towering brick minaret never gets old. It pops up in 
                    our old family albums and our friends’ latest Instagram feeds alike; it never 
                    ceases to amaze people, both young and old. And did you know that Qutub Minar
                     has earned a place in UNESCO’s Heritage Sites list and for the right reasons? 
                     The Minar, which is touted to be the world’s tallest minaret made up of bricks, 
                     is 73 meters or 293.5 feet tall, consisting of five stories. The monument is a 
                     relic of the Delhi Sultanate and its construction was completed by many kings 
                     over the years. Founder of the Delhi Sultanate, Qutb-Ud-din-Aibak (the Sufi saint 
                     after whom the structure was named), began building this gigantic structure in 1192 
                     and went up to constructing the first story while the remaining stories were completed 
                     Iltutmish and Firoz Shah Tughlaq.  The minaret consists of 
                     Parso-Arabic and Nagari inscriptions in various sections that reveal the history of its making.

     <div id="redfort">
        <h2 id="red"><u>The Red Fort or Lal Qila</u></h2>
        <p>Red Fort was named one among the UNESCO World Heritage Sites 
            in Delhi in the year 2007 for its beautiful blend of culturally different 
            architectural designs and also for standing valiantly as the symbol of power 
            since the reign of Shah Jahan, even though it was attacked and damaged by 
            numerous dynasties, including the British. The outstanding planning incorporated 
            in the fort, and its garden design which inspired gardens in Rajasthan, Agra, etc. 
            also helped it earn this status.This architectural beauty is also based on the garden design, 
            and incorporates water channels called Nahr-i-Behisht (or Stream of Paradise) connecting the
             pavilions that are present in the private apartments.  Adjacent to this monumental fort stands
              the Salimgarh fort which, together with the Red Fort forms the Red Fort Complex.
