        <p>Khajuraho Temples (in Madhya Pradesh) are among the most beautiful medieval monuments in the country.
            Built between 950-1050 AD by the Chandela Dynasty.
            The monuments include Hindu and Jain temples.
            The temple site is situated within Vindhya Mountain range.
            These Temples got the status of UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites in 1986.
            The temples are famous for their Nagara-style architectural symbolism.
            Reported for the first time by Abu Rihan al Biruni in AD 1022 and Ibn Battuta
            in AD 1335.Erotic imagery is very common in the Temples of Khajuraho. Sculptures of 
            celestial nymphs with broad hips, heavy breasts and languishing eyes are commonly found 
            in the Kandariya Mahadeva and Vishwanath Temple.signifying how sexual procreation and 
             kama are an essential aspect of human life.The major focus of the study of the Temples of 
             Khajuraho have been on the sculptures. The walls of these temples have some of the best sculptures
              of the time, making Khajuraho a representation of excellent artistic features.

    <!--for Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi-->
    <div id="buddhist">
        <h2 id="bud"><p align='center'><u>Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi</u></p></h2>
        <p>It was the Indian emperor Ashoka’s embrace of Buddhism in the 3rd century BC 
            that turned it into one of the world’s major religions. Here at Sanchi, you 
            can see the greatest tribute he built to his new faith – an enormous stupa 
            containing relics of Buddha himself. The intricate carved stone artworks telling 
            historical stories help make the Great Stupa of Sanchi one of the marvels of the 
            ancient world. Presently under an UNESCO project Sanchi and Satdhara, a Buddhist site,
             10 km south-east of Sanchi, is being further excavated, conserved and environmentally developed.

        <h2 id="bhem"><p align='center'><u>Rock shelters of BhimBhetka</u></p></h2>
        <p>The shelters exhibit the earliest traces of human life in India, its rock
             paintings are among the world's oldest. The inscribed area consists of 5 
             clusters (5 hills) of in total ca. 400 shelters. The paintings, largely in 
             white and red, show the varied animal life which shared the forest environment 
             with the prehistoric people, and of the various facets - economic and social - of 
             the peoples' lives. Later more elaborate paintings such as large processions of men
              on horses and elephants, battle scenes depicting spears, bows, arrows, shields and 
              swords were added.More than 750 sandstone rock shelters have earned Bhimbetka the
               prestigious UNESCO World Heritage Site status. Not because of the legend, but because 
               this site is an archaeological site dating back to the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods.
                Studies have shown some of the earliest traces of human life, right from the Stone Age.
